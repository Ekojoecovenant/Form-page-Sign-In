# Form-page
 My first project on the creation of a sign-in form page.

This is a simple responsive sign-in form page designed for user authentication. It provides a user friendly interface for users to securely sign in to their accounts. This project was created to practice front-end development skills.

KEY FEATURES:
1. User Authentication: Allows users to securely sign in to their accounts.
2. Input Validation: Validates user input to ensure data integrity and security.
3. Responsive Design: Ensures the sign-in form page is accessible and usable accross different devices and screen sizes.

USAGE:
1. Sign In: Fill in your username and password in the provided fields.
2. Validation: Ensure both username and password fields are filled before attempting to sign in.
3. Error Handling: If you encounter any errors during sign-in, such as incorrect credentials, an error message will be displayed.
4. Forgot Password: If you forget your password, click on the "Forgot Password" link to reset it.
5. Create Account: If you don't have an account, click on the "Create Account" link to resigter.
